        <h2>Feature 1 - Scrolling Scene</h2>
        <p>Seemless scrolling screen of a street view. Each of the scenes are interactable by click to bring up statistics related to the clicked scene.</p>
        <h3>Technologies Required</h3>
        <p>I'm planning on using the same library I used for my studio 3, <a href="https://www.jqueryscript.net/animation/Endless-Horizontal-Content-Scroller-Plugin-For-jQuery-endlessRiver.html">endlessRiver</a>. The main concern/challenge is getting the art since I'm not much of an artist and drawing scenes is something I'm not very familiar with.</p>

        <h2>Feature 2 - Switch Mode Between Car and Bus</h2>
        <p>Ability to switch between two different modes with different sets of statistics and facts to explore.</p>
        <h3>Technologies Required</h3>
        <p>I think the implementation of this feature will be similar to what I did for my studio 1 assignment. To keep track of the scenes and facts associated with them, I might use objects.</p>
