    <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>For the topic for my Capstone Project, I'm planning to do research the topic of city planning in America and how it affects various aspect of our lives from our heavy reliance on cars to how it affects house affordability and homelessness. At the moment, I have no plans to work with a partner, however, I'd be more than happy to work with someone who shares the topic with or have something similar to me. I think this project along with my topic is a great opportunity to do something fun with data visualization. I think it would be fun to have an animated page that's interactive and responsive to user's scrolling. I am, however, concerned that this project will need a lot of animation, something I am not particularly good at. Furthermore, I'm working on an interactive page that needs scrolling and it's a bit challenging for me.</p>
