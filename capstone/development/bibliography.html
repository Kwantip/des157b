            </h2>
            <p>This article is very similar to my project topic where it briefly discuss the consequences of a car-centric city-planning. Some points the article went over include the environmental and the socieoeconomic impacts. This is perfect for my topic since it's exactly the points I'm trying to make. The article itself is relatively short, however, so it would be a great starting point for my project.</p>

            <p>This is a video made by a channel that's dedicated to discussing human-centric city-planning. This video describe "strode" as a combination between roads and streets. Roads is designed for cars and is the space/mean to get from point A to point B while streets are more of a destination and more for human. Strode is a combination of both which isn't great by many aspects such as not being human-friendly and also dangerous for all parties involved. This video act as is a great example to my point for my project.</p>

            <p>This article is similar to the first one, but went into details about the consequences of car-centric infrastructures. One of the key takeaway from this is about how this is a never-ending loop where inefficient land use lead to more less space and more reliant on cars which leads us to expand more horizontally rather than veritcally. This will be perfect for my project since it's exactly the point I'm trying to get across.</p>
